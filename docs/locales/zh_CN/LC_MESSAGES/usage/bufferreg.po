"User Buffer Registration is a feature that allows NCCL to directly "
"send/receive/operate data through the user buffer without extra internal "
"copy. It can accelerate collectives and reduce the resource usage (e.g. "
"#channel usage)."

"NCCL 2.19.x now supports user buffer registration for NVLink Switch; any "
"NCCL collectives that support NVLS algorithm can utilize this feature. To"
" enable the *CUDA Graph based* buffer registration, users have to comply "
"with several requirements:"
