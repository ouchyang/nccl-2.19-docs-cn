"(Since NCCL 2.7) Point-to-point communication can be used to express any "
"communication pattern between ranks. Any point-to-point communication "
"needs two NCCL calls : a call to :c:func:`ncclSend` on one rank and a "
"corresponding :c:func:`ncclRecv` on the other rank, with the same count "
"and data type."

"Multiple calls to :c:func:`ncclSend` and :c:func:`ncclRecv` targeting "
"different peers can be fused together with :c:func:`ncclGroupStart` and "
":c:func:`ncclGroupEnd` to form more complex communication patterns such "
"as one-to-all (scatter), all-to-one (gather), all-to-all or communication"
" with neighbors in a N-dimensional space."

"Point-to-point calls within a group will be blocking until that group of "
"calls completes, but calls within a group can be seen as progressing "
"independently, hence should never block each other. It is therefore "
"important to merge calls that need to progress concurrently to avoid "
"deadlocks."
