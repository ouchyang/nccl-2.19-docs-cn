"CUDA Graphs provide a way to define workflows as graphs rather than single operations. They may reduce overhead by "
"launching multiple GPU operations through a single CPU operation. More details about CUDA Graphs can be found in the "

"CUDA图形提供了一种将工作流定义为图形而不是单个操作的方式。它们可以通过单个CPU操作启动多个GPU操作，从而减少开销。有关CUDA图形的更多详细信息，请参阅`CUDA编程指南<https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/"

"Having multiple outstanding NCCL operations that are any combination of graph-captured or non-captured is supported. "
"There is a caveat that the mechanism NCCL uses internally to accomplish this has been seen to cause CUDA to deadlock "
"when the graphs of multiple communicators are cudaGraphLaunch()'d from the same thread. To disable this mechansim see "
"the environment variable :ref:`NCCL_GRAPH_MIXING_SUPPORT`."
msgstr ""
"支持具有任意组合的图捕获或非捕获的多个未完成的 NCCL 操作。有一个警告，NCCL 用于实现此功能的内部机制已被发现在从同一线程 cudaGraphLaunch() 多个通信器的图时导致 CUDA 死锁。要禁用此机制，请参阅环境变量 "
":ref:`NCCL_GRAPH_MIXING_SUPPORT`。"
