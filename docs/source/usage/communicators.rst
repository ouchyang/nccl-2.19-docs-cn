Creating a Communicator
***********************

When creating a communicator, a unique rank between 0 and n-1 has to be assigned to each of the n CUDA devices which
are part of the communicator. Using the same CUDA device multiple times as different ranks of the same NCCL
communicator is not supported and may lead to hangs.

Given a static mapping of ranks to CUDA devices, the :c:func:`ncclCommInitRank`, :c:func:`ncclCommInitRankConfig` and
:c:func:`ncclCommInitAll` functions will create communicator objects, each communicator object being associated to a
fixed rank and CUDA device. Those objects will then be used to launch communication operations.

Before calling :c:func:`ncclCommInitRank`, you need to first create a unique object which will be used by all processes
and threads to synchronize and understand they are part of the same communicator. This is done by calling the
:c:func:`ncclGetUniqueId` function.

The :c:func:`ncclGetUniqueId` function returns an ID which has to be broadcast to all participating threads and
processes using any CPU communication system, for example, passing the ID pointer to multiple threads, or broadcasting
it to other processes using MPI or another parallel environment using, for example, sockets.

You can also call the ncclCommInitAll operation to create n communicator objects at once within a single process. As it
is limited to a single process, this function does not permit inter-node communication. ncclCommInitAll is equivalent
to calling a combination of ncclGetUniqueId and ncclCommInitRank.

The following sample code is a simplified implementation of ncclCommInitAll.  

.. code:: C

 ncclResult_t ncclCommInitAll(ncclComm_t* comm, int ndev, const int* devlist) {
   ncclUniqueId Id;
   ncclGetUniqueId(&Id);
   ncclGroupStart();
   for (int i=0; i<ndev; i++) {
     cudaSetDevice(devlist[i]);
     ncclCommInitRank(comm+i, ndev, Id, i);
   }
   ncclGroupEnd();
 }

.. _init-rank-config:

Creating a communication with options
-------------------------------------

The :c:func:`ncclCommInitRankConfig` function allows to create a NCCL communication with specific options.

The config parameters NCCL supports are listed here :ref:`ncclconfig`.

For example, "blocking" can be set to 0 to ask NCCL to never block in any NCCL call, and at the same time
other config parameters can be set as well to more precisely define communicator behavior. A simple example
code is shown below:

.. code:: C

  ncclConfig_t config = NCCL_CONFIG_INITIALIZER;
  config.blocking = 0;
  config.minCTAs = 4;
  config.maxCTAs = 16;
  config.cgaClusterSize = 2;
  config.netName = "Socket";
  CHECK(ncclCommInitRankConfig(&comm, nranks, id, rank, &config));
  do {
    CHECK(ncclCommGetAsyncError(comm, &state));
    // Handle outside events, timeouts, progress, ...
  } while(state == ncclInProgress);

Creating more communicators
---------------------------

The ncclCommSplit function can be used to create a communicators based on existing one. This allows to split an existing
communicator into multiple sub-partitions, duplicate an existing communicator, or even create a single communicator with
less ranks.

The ncclCommSplit function needs to be called by all ranks in the original communicator. If some ranks will not be part
of any sub-group, they still need to call ncclCommSplit with color being NCCL_SPLIT_NOCOLOR.

Newly created communicators will inherit the parent communicator configuration (e.g. non-blocking).
If the parent communicator operates in non-blocking mode, a ncclCommSplit operation may be stopped by calling ncclCommAbort
on the parent communicator, then on any new communicator returned. This is because a hang could happen during
operations on any of the two communicators.

The following code duplicates an existing communicator:

.. code:: C

 int rank;
 ncclCommUserRank(comm, &rank);
 ncclCommSplit(comm, 0, rank, &newcomm, NULL);

This splits a communicator in two halves:

.. code:: C

 int rank, nranks;
 ncclCommUserRank(comm, &rank);
 ncclCommCount(comm, &nranks);
 ncclCommSplit(comm, rank/(nranks/2), rank%(nranks/2), &newcomm, NULL);

This creates a communicator with only the first 2 ranks:

.. code:: C

 int rank;
 ncclCommUserRank(comm, &rank);
 ncclCommSplit(comm, rank<2 ? 0 : NCCL_SPLIT_NOCOLOR, rank, &newcomm, NULL);

Using multiple NCCL communicators concurrently
----------------------------------------------

Using multiple NCCL communicators requires careful synchronization, or can lead to deadlocks.

NCCL kernels are blocking (waiting for data to arrive), and any CUDA operation can cause a device synchronization,
meaning it will wait for all NCCL kernels to complete. This can quickly lead to deadlocks since NCCL operations perform
CUDA calls themselves.

Operations on different communicators should therefore be used at different epochs with a locking mechanism, and
applications should ensure operations are submitted in the same order across ranks.

Launching multiple communication operations (on different streams) might work provided they can fit within the GPU, but
could break at any time if NCCL were to use more CUDA blocks per operation, or if some calls used inside NCCL
collectives were to perform a device synchronization (e.g. allocate some CUDA memory dynamically).

Finalizing a communicator
-------------------------

ncclCommFinalize will transition a communicator from the *ncclSuccess* state to the *ncclInProgress* state, start 
completing all operations in the background and synchronize with other ranks which may be using resources for their 
communications with other ranks.
All uncompleted operations and network-related resources associated to a communicator will be flushed and freed with 
ncclCommFinalize. 
Once all NCCL operations are complete, the communicator will transition to the *ncclSuccess* state. Users can 
query that state with ncclCommGetAsyncError.
If a communicator is marked as nonblocking, this operation is nonblocking; otherwise, it is blocking.

Destroying a communicator
-------------------------

Once a communicator has been finalized, the next step is to free all resources, including the communicator itself.
Local resources associated to a communicator can be destroyed with ncclCommDestroy. If the state of a communicator 
become *ncclSuccess* before calling ncclCommDestroy, ncclCommDestroy call will guarantee nonblocking; on the contrary, 
ncclCommDestroy might be blocked. 
In all cases, ncclCommDestroy call will free resources of the communicator and return, and
the communicator should not longer be accessed after ncclCommDestroy returns.

*************************************
Error handling and communicator abort
*************************************

All NCCL calls return a NCCL error code which is sumarized in the table below. If a NCCL call returns an error code
different from ncclSuccess and ncclInternalError, NCCL will print a human-readable message explaining what happened
if NCCL_DEBUG is set to WARN. If NCCL_DEBUG is set to INFO, it will also print the call stack which lead to the error.
This message is intended to help the user fix the problem.

The table below summarizes how different errors should be understood and handled. Each case is explained in details
in the following sections.

(1) ncclUnhandledCudaError and ncclSystemError indicate that a call NCCL made to an external component failed,
which caused the NCCL operation to fail. The error message should explain which component the user should look
at and try to fix, potentially with the help of the administrators of the system.

(2) ncclInternalError denotes a NCCL bug. It might not report a message with NCCL_DEBUG=WARN since it requires a
fix in the NCCL source code. NCCL_DEBUG=INFO will print the back trace which lead to the error.

(3) ncclInvalidArgument indicates an argument value is incorrect, like a NULL pointer, or an out-of-bounds value.
When this error is returned, the NCCL call had no effect. The group state remains unchanged, the communicator is
still functioning normally. The application can call ncclCommAbort or continue as if the call did not happen.
This error will be returned immediately for a call happening within a group and applies to that specific NCCL
call. It will not be returned by ncclGroupEnd since ncclGroupEnd takes no argument.

(4) ncclInvalidUsage is returned when a dynamic condition causes a failure, which denotes an incorrect usage of
the NCCL API.

(5) These errors are fatal for the communicator. To recover, the application needs to call ncclCommAbort on the
communicator and re-create it.

(6) Dynamic errors for operations within a group are always reported by ncclGroupEnd and apply to all operations
within the group, which may or may not have completed. The application must call ncclCommAbort on all communicators
within the group.

Asynchronous errors and error handling
--------------------------------------

Some communication errors, and in particular network errors, are reported through the ncclCommGetAsyncError function.
Operations experiencing an asynchronous error will usually not progress and never complete. When an asynchronous error
happens, the operation should be aborted and the communicator destroyed using ncclCommAbort.
When waiting for NCCL operations to complete, applications should call ncclCommGetAsyncError and destroy the
communicator when an error happens.

The following code shows how to wait on NCCL operations and poll for asynchronous errors, instead of using
cudaStreamSynchronize.

.. code:: C

 int ncclStreamSynchronize(cudaStream_t stream, ncclComm_t comm) {
   cudaError_t cudaErr;
   ncclResult_t ncclErr, ncclAsyncErr;
   while (1) {
    cudaErr = cudaStreamQuery(stream);
    if (cudaErr == cudaSuccess)
      return 0;

    if (cudaErr != cudaErrorNotReady) {
      printf("CUDA Error : cudaStreamQuery returned %d\n", cudaErr);
      return 1;
    }

    ncclErr = ncclCommGetAsyncError(comm, &ncclAsyncErr);
    if (ncclErr != ncclSuccess) {
      printf("NCCL Error : ncclCommGetAsyncError returned %d\n", ncclErr);
      return 1;
    }

    if (ncclAsyncErr != ncclSuccess) {
      // An asynchronous error happened. Stop the operation and destroy
      // the communicator
      ncclErr = ncclCommAbort(comm);
      if (ncclErr != ncclSuccess)
        printf("NCCL Error : ncclCommDestroy returned %d\n", ncclErr);
      // Caller may abort or try to re-create a new communicator.
      return 2;
    }

    // We might want to let other threads (including NCCL threads) use the CPU.
    sched_yield();
   }
 }

***************
Fault Tolerance 
***************

NCCL provides a set of features to allow applications to recover from fatal errors such as network failure,
node failure, or process failure. When such an error happens, the application should be able to call ncclCommAbort
on the communicator to free all resources, then recreate a new communicator to continue.
All NCCL calls can be non-blocking to ensure ncclCommAbort can be called at any point, during initialization,
communication or when finalizing the communicator.

To correctly abort, when any rank in a communicator fails (e.g., due to segmentation fault), all other ranks need to 
call *ncclCommAbort* to abort their own NCCL communicator.
Users can implement methods to decide when and whether to abort the communicators and restart the NCCL operation.
Here is an example showing how to initialize and split a communicator in a non-blocking manner, allowing for abort at any point:

.. code:: C

  bool globalFlag;
  bool abortFlag = false;
  ncclConfig_t config = NCCL_CONFIG_INITIALIZER;
  config.blocking = 0;
  CHECK(ncclCommInitRankConfig(&comm, nRanks, id, myRank, &config));
  do {
    CHECK(ncclCommGetAsyncError(comm, &state));
  } while(state == ncclInProgress && checkTimeout() != true);

  if (checkTimeout() == true || state != ncclSuccess) abortFlag = true;

  /* sync abortFlag among all healthy ranks. */
  reportErrorGlobally(abortFlag, &globalFlag);

  if (globalFlag) {
    /* time is out or initialization fails, every rank need to abort and restart. */
    ncclCommAbort(comm);
    /* restart NCCL; this is a user implemented function, it might include
     * resource clean and ncclCommInitRankConfig() to create new communicators. */
    restartNCCL(&comm);
  }

  /* nonblocking communicator split. */
  CHECK(ncclCommSplit(comm, color, key, &childComm, &config));
  do {
    CHECK(ncclCommGetAsyncError(comm, &state));
  } while(state == ncclInProgress && checkTimeout() != true);

  if (checkTimeout() == true || state != ncclSuccess) abortFlag = true;

  /* sync abortFlag among all healthy ranks. */
  reportErrorGlobally(abortFlag, &globalFlag);

  if (globalFlag) {
    ncclCommAbort(comm);
    /* if chilComm is not NCCL_COMM_NULL, user should abort child communicator 
     * here as well for resource reclaimation. */
    if (childComm != NCCL_COMM_NULL) ncclCommAbort(childComm);
    restartNCCL(&comm);
  }
  /* application workload */

*checkTimeout* function is just an example and provided by users to determine what is the longest time the application should wait for
NCCL initialization; likewise, users can apply other methods to detect errors besides timeout function. Similar methods can be applied 
to NCCL finalization as well.
