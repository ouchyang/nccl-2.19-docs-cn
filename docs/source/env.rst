#####################
Environment Variables
#####################

NCCL has an extensive set of environment variables to tune for specific usage.

They can also be set statically in /etc/nccl.conf (for an administrator to set system-wide values) or in ~/.nccl.conf (for users). For example, those files could contain :

.. code:: C

 NCCL_DEBUG=WARN
 NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME==ens1f0

NCCL_P2P_DISABLE
----------------

The ``NCCL_P2P_DISABLE`` variable disables the peer to peer (P2P) transport, which uses CUDA direct access between GPUs, using NVLink or PCI.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define and set to 1 to disable direct GPU-to-GPU (P2P) communication.

NCCL_P2P_LEVEL
--------------
(since 2.3.4)

The ``NCCL_P2P_LEVEL`` variable allows the user to finely control when to use the peer to peer (P2P) transport between GPUs.
The level defines the maximum distance between GPUs where NCCL will use the P2P transport.  A short string representing
the path type should be used to specify the topographical cutoff for using the P2P transport.

If this isn't specified, NCCL will attempt to optimally select a value based on the architecture and environment it's run in. 

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- LOC : Never use P2P (always disabled)
- NVL : Use P2P when GPUs are connected through NVLink
- PIX : Use P2P when GPUs are on the same PCI switch.
- PXB : Use P2P when GPUs are connected through PCI switches (potentially multiple hops).
- PHB : Use P2P when GPUs are on the same NUMA node. Traffic will go through the CPU.
- SYS : Use P2P between NUMA nodes, potentially crossing the SMP interconnect (e.g. QPI/UPI).

Integer Values (Legacy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is also the option to declare ``NCCL_P2P_LEVEL`` as an integer corresponding to the path type.  These numerical values were kept for retro-compatibility, for those who used numerical values before strings were allowed.

Integer values are discouraged due to breaking changes in path types - the literal values can change over time.  To avoid headaches debugging your configuration, use string identifiers.

- LOC : 0
- PIX : 1
- PXB : 2
- PHB : 3
- SYS : 4

Values greater than 4 will be interpreted as SYS.  NVL is not supported using the legacy level ints.

NCCL_P2P_DIRECT_DISABLE
-----------------------
The ``NCCL_P2P_DIRECT_DISABLE`` variable forbids NCCL to directly access user buffers through P2P between GPUs of the same process. This is useful when user buffers are allocated with APIs which do not automatically make them accessible to other GPUs managed by the same process and with P2P access.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define and set to 1 to disable direct user buffer access across GPUs.

NCCL_SHM_DISABLE
----------------
The ``NCCL_SHM_DISABLE`` variable disables the Shared Memory (SHM) transports. SHM is used between devices when peer-to-peer cannot happen, therefore, host memory is used.  NCCL will use network (i.e. InfiniBand or IP sockets) to communicate between the CPU sockets when SHM is disabled.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define and set to 1 to disable communication through shared memory (SHM).

NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME
------------------

The ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`` variable specifies which IP interface to use for communication.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define to a list of prefixes to filter interfaces to be used by NCCL.

Using the ``^`` symbol, NCCL will exclude interfaces starting with any prefix in that list.

To match (or not) an exact interface name instead of a prefix, prefix the string with the ``=`` character.

Examples:

``eth`` : Use all interfaces starting with ``eth``, e.g. ``eth0``, ``eth1``, ...

``=eth0`` : Use only interface ``eth0``

``^docker`` : Do not use any interface starting with ``docker``

``^=docker0`` : Do not use interface ``docker0``.

Note: By default, the loopback interface (``lo``) and docker interfaces (``docker*``) would not be selected unless there are no other interfaces available. If you prefer to use ``lo`` or ``docker*`` over other interfaces, you would need to explicitly select them using ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME``. The default algorithm will also favor interfaces starting with ``ib`` over others. Setting ``NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME`` will bypass the automatic interface selection algorithm and may use all interfaces matching the manual selection.

NCCL_SOCKET_FAMILY
------------------

The ``NCCL_SOCKET_FAMILY`` variable allows users to force NCCL to use only IPv4 or IPv6 interface.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set to ``AF_INET`` to force the use of IPv4, or ``AF_INET6`` to force IPv6 usage.

NCCL_SOCKET_NTHREADS
--------------------
(since 2.4.8)

The ``NCCL_SOCKET_NTHREADS`` variable specifies the number of CPU helper threads used per network connection for socket transport. Increasing this value may increase the socket transport performance, at the cost of higher CPU usage.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1 to 16. On AWS, the default value is 2; on Google Cloud instances with the gVNIC network interface, the default value is 4 (since 2.5.6); in other cases, the default value is 1.

For generic 100G networks, this value can be manually set to 4. However, the product of ``NCCL_SOCKET_NTHREADS`` and ``NCCL_NSOCKS_PERTHREAD`` cannot exceed 64. See also ``NCCL_NSOCKS_PERTHREAD``.

NCCL_NSOCKS_PERTHREAD
---------------------
(since 2.4.8)

The ``NCCL_NSOCKS_PERTHREAD`` variable specifies the number of sockets opened by each helper thread of the socket transport. In environments where per-socket speed is limited, setting this variable larger than 1 may improve the network performance.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
On AWS, the default value is 8; in other cases, the default value is 1.

For generic 100G networks, this value can be manually set to 4. However, the product of ``NCCL_SOCKET_NTHREADS`` and ``NCCL_NSOCKS_PERTHREAD`` cannot exceed 64. See also ``NCCL_SOCKET_NTHREADS``.

.. _NCCL_DEBUG:

NCCL_DEBUG
----------

The ``NCCL_DEBUG`` variable controls the debug information that is displayed from NCCL. This variable is commonly used for debugging.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
VERSION - Prints the NCCL version at the start of the program.

WARN - Prints an explicit error message whenever any NCCL call errors out.

INFO - Prints debug information

TRACE - Prints replayable trace information on every call.

NCCL_BUFFSIZE
-------------
The ``NCCL_BUFFSIZE`` variable controls the size of the buffer used by NCCL when communicating data between pairs of GPUs.

Use this variable if you encounter memory constraint issues when using NCCL or you think that a different buffer size would improve performance.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is 4194304 (4 MB).

Values are integers, in bytes. The recommendation is to use powers of 2. For example,  1024 will give a 1K buffer.


NCCL_NTHREADS
-------------
The ``NCCL_NTHREADS`` variable sets the number of CUDA threads per CUDA block. NCCL will launch one CUDA block per communication channel.

Use this variable if you think your GPU clocks are low and you want to increase the number of threads.

You can also use this variable to reduce the number of threads to decrease the GPU workload.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is 512 for recent generation GPUs, and 256 for some older generations.

The values allowed are 64, 128, 256 and 512.

NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS
------------------
(NCCL_MAX_NRINGS since 2.0.5, NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS since 2.5.0)

The ``NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS`` variable limits the number of channels NCCL can use. Reducing the number of channels also reduces the
number of CUDA blocks used for communication, hence the impact on GPU computing resources.

The old ``NCCL_MAX_NRINGS`` variable (used until 2.4) still works as an alias in newer versions but is ignored if ``NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS`` is set.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Any value above or equal to 1.

NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS
------------------
(NCCL_MIN_NRINGS since 2.2.0, NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS since 2.5.0)

The ``NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS`` variable controls the minimum number of channels you want NCCL to use.
Increasing the number of channels also increases the number of
CUDA blocks NCCL uses, which may be useful to improve performance; however, it uses more CUDA compute resources.

This is especially useful when using aggregated collectives on platforms where NCCL would usually only create one channel.

The old ``NCCL_MIN_NRINGS`` variable (used until 2.4) still works as an alias in newer versions, but is ignored if ``NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS`` is set.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is platform dependent. Set to an integer value, up to 12 (up to 2.2), 16 (2.3 and 2.4) or 32 (2.5 and later).

NCCL_CROSS_NIC
--------------
The ``NCCL_CROSS_NIC`` variable controls whether NCCL should allow rings/trees to use different NICs,
causing inter-node communication to use different NICs on different nodes.

To maximize inter-node communication performance when using multiple NICs, NCCL tries to communicate
between same NICs between nodes, to allow for network design where each NIC from each node connects to
a different network switch (network rail), and avoid any risk of traffic flow interference.
The ``NCCL_CROSS_NIC`` setting is therefore dependent on the network topology, and in particular
depending on whether the network fabric is rail-optimized or not.

This has no effect on systems with only one NIC.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0: Always use the same NIC for the same ring/tree, to avoid crossing network rails. Suited for networks
with per NIC switches (rails), with a slow inter-rail connection. Note there are corner cases for which
NCCL may still cause cross-rail communication, so rails still need to be connected at the top.

1: Do not attempt to use the same NIC for the same ring/tree. This is suited for networks where all NICs
from a node are connected to the same switch, hence trying to communicate across the same NICs does not
help avoiding flow collisions.

2: (Default) Try to use the same NIC for the same ring/tree, but still allow for it if it would result
in better performance.

NCCL_CHECKS_DISABLE
-------------------
(since 2.0.5, deprecated in 2.2.12)

The ``NCCL_CHECKS_DISABLE`` variable can be used to disable argument checks on each collective call.
Checks are useful during development but can increase the latency. They can be disabled to
improve performance in production.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is 0, set to 1 to disable checks.

NCCL_CHECK_POINTERS
-------------------
(since 2.2.12)

The ``NCCL_CHECK_POINTERS`` variable enables checking of the CUDA memory pointers on each collective call.
Checks are useful during development but can increase the latency.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is 0, set to 1 to enable checking.

Setting to 1 restores the original behavior of NCCL prior to 2.2.12.

NCCL_LAUNCH_MODE
----------------
(since 2.1.0)

The ``NCCL_LAUNCH_MODE`` variable controls how NCCL launches CUDA kernels.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value is PARALLEL.

Setting is to GROUP will use cooperative groups (CUDA 9.0 and later) for processes managing more than one GPU.
This is deprecated in 2.9 and may be removed in future versions.

NCCL_IB_DISABLE
---------------

The ``NCCL_IB_DISABLE`` variable disables the IB/RoCE transport that is to be used by NCCL. Instead, NCCL will fallback to
using IP sockets.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define and set to 1 to disable the use of InfiniBand Verbs for communication (and force another method, e.g. IP sockets).

NCCL_IB_HCA
-----------
The ``NCCL_IB_HCA`` variable specifies which RDMA interfaces to use for communication.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define to filter IB Verbs interfaces to be used by NCCL. The list is comma-separated; port numbers can be specified using
the ``:`` symbol. An optional prefix ``^`` indicates the list is an exclude list. A second optional prefix ``=`` indicates
that the tokens are exact names, otherwise by default NCCL would treat each token as a prefix.

Examples:

``mlx5`` : Use all ports of all cards starting with ``mlx5``

``=mlx5_0:1,mlx5_1:1`` : Use ports 1 of cards ``mlx5_0`` and ``mlx5_1``.

``^=mlx5_1,mlx5_4`` : Do not use cards ``mlx5_1`` and ``mlx5_4``.

Note: using ``mlx5_1`` without a preceding ``=`` will select ``mlx5_1`` as well as ``mlx5_10`` to ``mlx5_19``, if they exist.
It is therefore always recommended to add the ``=`` prefix to ensure an exact match.

NCCL_IB_TIMEOUT
---------------
The ``NCCL_IB_TIMEOUT`` variable controls the InfiniBand Verbs Timeout.

The timeout is computed as 4.096 碌s * 2 ^ *timeout*, and the correct value is dependent on the size of the network.
Increasing that value can help on very large networks, for example, if NCCL is failing on a call to *ibv_poll_cq* with
error 12.

For more information, see section 12.7.34 of the InfiniBand specification Volume 1
(https://www.infinibandta.org/ibta-specifications-download) (Local Ack Timeout).

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value used by NCCL is 18 (since 2.14, it was 14 in previous versions).

Values can be 1-22.

NCCL_IB_RETRY_CNT
-----------------
(since 2.1.15)

The ``NCCL_IB_RETRY_CNT`` variable controls the InfiniBand retry count.

For more information, see section 12.7.38 of the InfiniBand specification Volume 1
(https://www.infinibandta.org/ibta-specifications-download).

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value is 7.

NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX
-----------------
(since 2.1.4)

The ``NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX`` variable defines the Global ID index used in RoCE mode.
See the InfiniBand *show_gids* command in order to set this value.

For more information, see the InfiniBand specification Volume 1
(https://www.infinibandta.org/ibta-specifications-download) or vendor documentation.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value is 0.

NCCL_IB_SL
----------
(since 2.1.4)

Defines the InfiniBand Service Level.

For more information, see the InfiniBand specification Volume 1
(https://www.infinibandta.org/ibta-specifications-download) or vendor documentation.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value is 0.

NCCL_IB_TC
----------
(since 2.1.15)

Defines the InfiniBand traffic class field.

For more information, see the InfiniBand specification Volume 1
(https://www.infinibandta.org/ibta-specifications-download) or vendor documentation.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value is 0.

NCCL_IB_AR_THRESHOLD
--------------------
(since 2.6)

Threshold after which we send InfiniBand data in a separate message which can
leverage adaptive routing.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Size in bytes, the default value is 8192.

Setting it above NCCL_BUFFSIZE will disable the use of adaptive routing completely.

NCCL_IB_CUDA_SUPPORT
--------------------
(removed in 2.4.0, see NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL)

The ``NCCL_IB_CUDA_SUPPORT`` variable is used to force or disable the usage of GPU Direct RDMA.
By default, NCCL enables GPU Direct RDMA, if the topology permits it. This variable can disable this behavior or force
the usage of GPU Direct RDMA in all cases.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define and set to 0 to disable GPU Direct RDMA.

Define and set to 1 to force the usage of GPU Direct RDMA.

NCCL_IB_QPS_PER_CONNECTION
--------------------------
(since 2.10)

Number of IB queue pairs to use for each connection between two ranks. This can be useful on multi-level fabrics which need multiple queue pairs to have good routing entropy.
See ``NCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_ON_QPS`` for different ways to split data on multiple QPs, as it can affect performance.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Number between 1 and 128, default is 1.

NCCL_IB_SPLIT_DATA_ON_QPS
-------------------------
(since 2.18)

This parameter controls how we use the queue pairs when we create more than one.
Set to 1 (split mode, default), each message will be split evenly on each queue pair. This may cause a visible latency degradation if we use many QPs.
Set to 0 (round-robin mode), queue pairs will be used in round-robin mode for each message we send. Operations which do not send multiple messages will not use all QPs.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default is 1. Setting it to 0 will switch to round-robin mode.

NCCL_IB_PCI_RELAXED_ORDERING
----------------------------
(since 2.12)

Enable use of Relaxed Ordering for the IB Verbs transport. Relaxed Ordering can greatly help the performance of InfiniBand networks in virtualized environments.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set to 2 to automatically use Relaxed Ordering if available. Set to 1 to force use of Relaxed Ordering and fail if not available. Set to 0 to disable use of Relaxed Ordering. Default is 2.

NCCL_IB_ADAPTIVE_ROUTING
------------------------
(since 2.16)

Enable use of Adaptive Routing capable data transfers for the IB Verbs transport. Adaptive routing can improve the performance of communications at scale. A system defined Adaptive Routing enabled SL has to be selected accordingly (cf. ``NCCL_IB_SL``).

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enabled (1) by default on IB networks. Disabled (0) by default on RoCE networks. Set to 1 to force use of Adaptive Routing capable data transmission.


NCCL_MEM_SYNC_DOMAIN
--------------------
(since 2.16)

Sets the default Memory Sync Domain for NCCL kernels (CUDA 12.0 & sm90 and later). Memory Sync Domains can help eliminate interference between the NCCL kernels and the application compute kernels, when they use different domains.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default value is ``cudaLaunchMemSyncDomainRemote`` (1). Currently supported values are 0 and 1.

NCCL_CUMEM_ENABLE
-----------------
(since 2.18)

Use CUDA cuMem* functions to allocate memory in NCCL.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default is 0.

NCCL_NET
--------
(since 2.10)

Forces NCCL to use a specific network, for example to make sure NCCL uses an external plugin and doesn't automatically fall back on the internal IB or Socket implementation. Setting this environment variable will override the ``netName`` configuration in all communicators (see :ref:`ncclConfig`); if not set (undefined), the network module will be determined by the configuration; if not passing configuration, NCCL will automatically choose the best network module.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The value of NCCL_NET has to match exactly the name of the NCCL network used (case-insensitive). Internal network names are "IB" (generic IB verbs) and "Socket" (TCP/IP sockets). External network plugins define their own names. Default value is undefined.

NCCL_NET_PLUGIN
---------------
(since 2.11)

Set it to a suffix string to choose among multiple NCCL net plugins. This setting will cause NCCL to look for file "libnccl-net-<suffix>.so" instead of the default "libnccl-net.so".

For example, setting ``NCCL_NET_PLUGIN=aws`` will cause NCCL to use libnccl-net-aws.so (provided that it exists on the system).  Setting ``NCCL_NET_PLUGIN=none`` will cause NCCL not to use any plugin.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suffix string of the plugin file name, or "none".

NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL (formerly NCCL_IB_GDR_LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------
(since 2.3.4. In 2.4.0, NCCL_IB_GDR_LEVEL is renamed NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL)

The ``NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL`` variable allows the user to finely control when to use GPU Direct RDMA between a NIC and a GPU.
The level defines the maximum distance between the NIC and the GPU. A string representing the path type should be used to specify the topographical cutoff for GpuDirect.

If this isn't specified, NCCL will attempt to optimally select a value based on the architecture and environment it's run in. 

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- LOC  : Never use GPU Direct RDMA. (always disabled)
- PIX  : Use GPU Direct RDMA when GPU and NIC are on the same PCI switch.
- PXB  : Use GPU Direct RDMA when GPU and NIC are connected through PCI switches (potentially multiple hops).
- PHB  : Use GPU Direct RDMA when GPU and NIC are on the same NUMA node. Traffic will go through the CPU.
- SYS  : Use GPU Direct RDMA even across the SMP interconnect between NUMA nodes (e.g., QPI/UPI). (always enabled)

Integer Values (Legacy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is also the option to declare ``NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL`` as an integer corresponding to the path type.  These numerical values were kept for retro-compatibility, for those who used numerical values before strings were allowed.

Integer values are discouraged due to breaking changes in path types - the literal values can change over time.  To avoid headaches debugging your configuration, use string identifiers.

- LOC : 0
- PIX : 1
- PXB : 2
- PHB : 3
- SYS : 4

Values greater than 4 will be interpreted as SYS.

NCCL_NET_GDR_READ
-----------------
The ``NCCL_NET_GDR_READ`` variable enables GPU Direct RDMA when sending data as long as the GPU-NIC distance is within the distance specified by ``NCCL_NET_GDR_LEVEL``. Before 2.4.2, GDR read is disabled by default, i.e. when sending data, the data is first stored in CPU memory, then goes to the InfiniBand card. Since 2.4.2, GDR read is enabled by default for NVLink-based platforms.

Note: Reading directly from GPU memory when sending data is known to be slightly slower than reading from CPU memory on some platforms, such as PCI-E.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Define and set to 1 to use GPU Direct RDMA to send data to the NIC directly (bypassing CPU).

Before 2.4.2, the default value is 0 for all platforms. Since 2.4.2, the default value is 1 for NVLink-based platforms and 0 otherwise.

NCCL_NET_SHARED_BUFFERS
-----------------------
(since 2.8)

Allows the usage of shared buffers for inter-node point-to-point communication.
This will use a single large pool for all remote peers, having a constant
memory usage instead of increasing linearly with the number of remote peers.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default is 1 (enabled). Set to 0 to disable.

NCCL_NET_SHARED_COMMS
---------------------
(since 2.12)

Reuse the same connections in the context of PXN. This allows for message
aggregation but can also decrease the entropy of network packets.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Default is 1 (enabled). Set to 0 to disable.

NCCL_SINGLE_RING_THRESHOLD
--------------------------
(since 2.1, removed in 2.3)

The ``NCCL_SINGLE_RING_THRESHOLD`` variable sets the limit under which NCCL will only use one ring.
This will limit bandwidth but improve latency.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value is 262144 (256kB) on GPUs with compute capability 7 and above. Otherwise, the default value is 131072 (128kB).

Values are integers, in bytes.

NCCL_LL_THRESHOLD
-----------------
(since 2.1, removed in 2.5)

The ``NCCL_LL_THRESHOLD`` variable sets the size limit under which NCCL uses low-latency algorithms.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is 16384 (up to 2.2) or is dependent on the number of ranks (2.3 and later).

Values are integers, in bytes.

NCCL_TREE_THRESHOLD
-------------------
(since 2.4, removed in 2.5)

The ``NCCL_TREE_THRESHOLD`` variable sets the size limit under which NCCL uses tree algorithms instead of rings.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is dependent on the number of ranks.

Values are integers, in bytes.

NCCL_ALGO
----------
(since 2.5)

The ``NCCL_ALGO`` variable defines which algorithms NCCL will use.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Comma-separated list of algorithms (not case sensitive) among: Tree, Ring, Collnet (up to 2.13), CollnetDirect (2.14+) and CollnetChain (2.14+).
NVLS (2.17+) is the algorithm used to enable NVLink SHARP offload.
To specify algorithms to exclude (instead of include), start the list with ^.

The default is ``Tree,Ring,CollnetDirect,CollnetChain,NVLS``.

NCCL_PROTO
----------
(since 2.5)

The ``NCCL_PROTO`` variable defines which protocol NCCL will use.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Comma-separated list of protocols (not case sensitive) among: LL, LL128, Simple. To specify protocols to exclude (instead of include), start the list with ^.

The default is ``LL,LL128,Simple`` on platforms which support LL128, ``LL,Simple`` otherwise.


NCCL_IGNORE_CPU_AFFINITY
------------------------
(since 2.4.6)

The ``NCCL_IGNORE_CPU_AFFINITY`` variable can be used to cause NCCL to ignore the job's supplied CPU affinity and instead use the GPU affinity only.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is 0, set to 1 to cause NCCL to ignore the job's supplied CPU affinity.


NCCL_DEBUG_FILE
---------------
(since 2.2.12)

The ``NCCL_DEBUG_FILE`` variable directs the NCCL debug logging output to a file.
The filename format can be set to *filename.%h.%p* where *%h* is replaced with the
hostname and *%p* is replaced with the process PID. This does not accept the ``~`` character as part of the path, please convert to a relative or absolute path first.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default output file is *stdout* unless this environment variable is set.

Setting ``NCCL_DEBUG_FILE`` will cause NCCL to create and overwrite any previous files of that name.

Note: If the filename is not unique across all the job processes, then the output may be lost or corrupted.

NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS
-----------------
(since 2.3.4)

The ``NCCL_DEBUG_SUBSYS`` variable allows the user to filter the ``NCCL_DEBUG=INFO`` output based on subsystems.
A comma separated list of the subsystems to include in the NCCL debug log traces.

Prefixing the subsystem name with `^` will disable the logging for that subsystem.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default value is INIT.

Supported subsystem names are INIT (stands for initialization), COLL (stands for collectives), P2P (stands for
peer-to-peer), SHM (stands for shared memory), NET (stands for network), GRAPH (stands for topology detection
and graph search), TUNING (stands for algorithm/protocol tuning), ENV (stands for environment settings), ALLOC (stands for memory allocations), and ALL (includes every subsystem).

NCCL_COLLNET_ENABLE
-------------------
(since 2.6)

Enable the use of CollNet plugin.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default is 0, define and set to 1 to use the CollNet plugin.

NCCL_COLLNET_NODE_THRESHOLD
---------------------------
(since 2.9.9)

A threshold for number of nodes below which CollNet will not be enabled.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default is 2, define and set to an integer.

NCCL_TOPO_FILE
--------------
(since 2.6)

Path to an XML file to load before detecting the topology. By default, NCCL will load ``/var/run/nvidia-topologyd/virtualTopology.xml`` if present.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A path to an accessible file describing part or all of the topology.

NCCL_TOPO_DUMP_FILE
-------------------
(since 2.6)

Path to an XML file to dump the topology after detection.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A path to a file which will be created or overwritten.

NCCL_NVB_DISABLE
----------------
(since 2.11)

Disable intra-node communication through NVLink via an intermediate GPU.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default is 0, set to 1 to disable that mechanism.

NCCL_PXN_DISABLE
----------------
(since 2.12)

Disable inter-node communication using a non-local NIC, using NVLink and
an intermediate GPU.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default is 0, set to 1 to disable that mechanism.

NCCL_P2P_PXN_LEVEL
------------------
(since 2.12)

Control in which cases PXN is used for send/receive operations.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A value of 0 will never use PXN for send/receive. A value of 1 will use PXN
when the NIC preferred by the destination is not directly accessible. A value
of 2 (default) will always use PXN even if the NIC is directly accessible,
storing data on the same intermediate GPU as other GPUs in the node to maximize
aggregation.

.. _NCCL_GRAPH_REGISTER:

NCCL_GRAPH_REGISTER
-------------------
(since 2.11)

Enable user buffer registration when NCCL calls are captured by CUDA Graphs.

Effective only when:
(i) the CollNet algorithm is being used;
(ii) all GPUs within a node have P2P access to each other;
(iii) there is at most one GPU per process.

User buffer registration may reduce the number of data copies between user buffers and the internal buffers of NCCL.
The user buffers will be automatically de-registered when the CUDA Graphs are destroyed.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default value is 1 (Enabled).

NCCL_LOCAL_REGISTER
-------------------
(since 2.19)

Enable user local buffer registration when users explicitly call *ncclCommRegister*.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default value is 1 (Enabled).

NCCL_SET_STACK_SIZE
-------------------
(since 2.9)

Set CUDA kernel stack size to the maximum stack size amongst all NCCL kernels.

It may avoid a CUDA memory reconfiguration on load. Set to 1 if you experience hang due to CUDA memory reconfiguration.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default value is 0.

NCCL_SET_THREAD_NAME
--------------------
(since 2.12)

Change the name of NCCL threads to ease debugging and analysis.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default is 0.

.. _NCCL_GRAPH_MIXING_SUPPORT:

NCCL_GRAPH_MIXING_SUPPORT
-------------------------
(since 2.13)

Enable/disable support for co-occurring outstanding NCCL launches from multiple
CUDA graphs or a CUDA graph and non-captured NCCL calls. With support disabled,
correctness is only guaranteed if the communicator always avoids both of the
following cases:

1. Has outstanding parallel graph launches, where parallel means on different
streams without dependencies that would otherwise serialize their execution.

2. An outstanding graph launch followed by a non-captured launch. Stream
dependencies are irrelevant.

The ability to disable support is motivated by observed hangs in the CUDA
launches when support is enabled and multiple ranks have work launched via
cudaGraphLaunch from the same thread.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default is 1.

NCCL_DMABUF_ENABLE
------------------
(since 2.13)

Enable GPU Direct RDMA buffer registration using the Linux dma-buf subsystem

The Linux dma-buf subsystem allows GPU Direct RDMA capable NICs to read and write CUDA buffers directly without CPU involvement.
This feature is enabled by default, but will be disabled if the Linux kernel or CUDA/NIC driver do not support it.

Value accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default value is 1.

NCCL_P2P_NET_CHUNKSIZE
----------------------
(since 2.14)

The ``NCCL_P2P_NET_CHUNKSIZE`` controls the size of messages sent through the network for ncclSend/ncclRecv operations.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The default is 131072 (128 K).

Values are integers, in bytes. The recommendation is to use powers of 2, hence 262144 would be the next value.

NCCL_P2P_LL_THRESHOLD
---------------------
(since 2.14)

The ``NCCL_P2P_LL_THRESHOLD`` is the maximum message size that NCCL will use LL for P2P operations.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Decimal number. Default is 16384.

NCCL_ALLOC_P2P_NET_LL_BUFFERS
-----------------------------
(since 2.14)

``NCCL_ALLOC_P2P_NET_LL_BUFFERS`` instructs communicators to allocate dedicated LL buffers for all P2P network connections.  This enables all ranks to use LL for latency-bound send and receive operations below ``NCCL_P2P_LL_THRESHOLD`` sizes.
Intranode P2P transfers always have dedicated LL buffers allocated.  If running all-to-all workloads with high numbers of ranks, this will result in a high scaling memory overhead.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. Default value is 0.

NCCL_COMM_BLOCKING
------------------
(since 2.14)

The ``NCCL_COMM_BLOCKING`` variable controls whether NCCL calls are allowed to block or not. This includes all calls to NCCL, including init/finalize functions, as well as communication functions which may also block due to the lazy initialization of connections for send/receive calls. Setting this environment variable will override the ``blocking`` configuration in all communicators (see :ref:`ncclConfig`); if not set (undefined), communicator behavior will be determined by the configuration; if not passing configuration, communicators are blocking.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 or 1. 1 indicates blocking communicators, and 0 indicates nonblocking communicators. The default value is undefined.

NCCL_CGA_CLUSTER_SIZE
---------------------
(since 2.16)

Set CUDA Cooperative Group Array (CGA) cluster size. On sm90 and later we have an extra level of hierarchy where we
can group together several blocks within the Grid, called Thread Block Clusters. Setting this to non-zero will cause
NCCL to launch the communication kernels with the Cluster Dimension attribute set accordingly. Setting this environment
variable will override the ``cgaClusterSize`` configuration in all communicators (see :ref:`ncclconfig`); if not set
(undefined), CGA cluster size will be determined by the configuration; if not passing configuration, NCCL will
automatically choose the best value.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
0 to 8. Default value is undefined.

NCCL_MAX_CTAS
-------------
(since 2.17)

Set the maximal number of CTAs the NCCL should use. Setting this environment variable will override the ``maxCTAs`` configuration in all communicators (see :ref:`ncclconfig`); if not set (undefined), maximal CTAs will be determined by the configuration; if not passing configuration, NCCL will automatically choose the best value.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set to a positive integer value up to 32. Default value is undefined.

NCCL_MIN_CTAS
-------------
(since 2.17)

Set the minimal number of CTAs the NCCL should use. Setting this environment variable will override the ``minCTAs`` configuration in all communicators (see :ref:`ncclconfig`); if not set (undefined), minimal CTAs will be determined by the configuration; if not passing configuration, NCCL will automatically choose the best value.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Set to a positive integer value up to 32. Default value is undefined.

NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE
----------------
(since 2.17)

Enable the use of NVLink SHARP (NVLS). NVLink SHARP is available in third-generation NVSwitch systems (NVLink4) with Hopper and later GPU architectures, allowing collectives such as ``ncclAllReduce`` to be offloaded to the NVSwitch domain.

Values accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Default is 1, define and set to 0 to disable use of NVLink SHARP. NVLS will be disabled automatically on systems which do not support the feature.
